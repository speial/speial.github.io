                In 2013 I did a lot of meditation. It made me pretty
                relaxed. 
                I was speculating as to whether this relaxation was going all
                the way down to all areas of my subconcious mind -- or was I
                still a raging tiger deep down inside, falling for an illusion
                of relaxation?
