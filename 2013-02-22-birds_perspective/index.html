Bird's perspective<br>
<br>
In this small piece from 2013, I tried to tear the paper into shapes. Instead of
cutting it in straight lines like I did in the two previous pieces.<br>
<br>
It is made from a beautiful abstract drawing by Jana Schumacher that was on the<br>
flyer for her exhibition "A matter of perspective".<br>
