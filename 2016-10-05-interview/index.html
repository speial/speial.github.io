<div class=caption>Why Speial Guest?</div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption>I was making these little collages and hiding them in the public restrooms of galleries. Then one day, one of the galleries officially exhibited one of my works. Since they did not know who made it, they put 'Special Guest' as the name. I liked that name and kept it. Later, I dropped the c in Special.</div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption>What's the most important thing youâ€™ve done?</div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption>I did not do anythnig important yet. Not sure if I ever will. I always just take the next step. Every time I do a piece, there is a new challenge.</div>
