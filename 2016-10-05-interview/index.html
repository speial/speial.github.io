<div class=caption><span>What's your name?</span></div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption>Speial Guest</div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption><span>Why Speial Guest?</span></div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption>I was making these little collages and hid them in the public restrooms of galleries. Then one day, one of the galleries officially exhibited one of them. Since they did not know who made it, they put 'Special Guest' as the name. I liked that name and kept it. Later, I dropped the c in Special.</div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption><span>What's the most important thing you've done?</span></div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption>In my experience, everything we accomplish is the accumulation of many, many little steps. Leaving the house or opening my mouth usually was the first step. So I would say leaving the house and opening your mouth is most important in this life.</div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption><span>In addition to collages, do you use any other techniques like watercolors, colors, ink or another method?</span></div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption>The only other art form I practice is ringing random doorbells. When I am in a new city, I sometimes look at the name plates on a random house, pick an interesting sounding name and press the button.</div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption><span>What means 'Speial Guest' to you?</span></div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption>It's a strangely fitting name. It expresses well the feeling of not belonging somewhere in the first place. But being there anyhow.</div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption><span>What is the process that you really like doing in your work?</span></div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption>I like the process of dreaming up a new piece. And I like the process of drinking a coke after all the work is done and I glued my piece to the wall.</div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption><span>What inspires you?</span></div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption>Most of my works are autobiographical. They capture something that I experienced or something that is currently going on in my life. I get a lot of energy when I see the works of other artists. Museums and art galleries are my favorite places.</div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption><span>Which profession you would hate to practice?</span></div>

<div></div>
<div class=caption>All of them! All I can do is play.</div>
