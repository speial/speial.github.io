  { "image": "", "text" : "I was making these little collages and hid them in the public restrooms of galleries. Then one day, one of the galleries officially exhibited one of them. Since they did not know who made it, they put 'Special Guest' as the name. I liked that name and kept it. Later, I dropped the c in Special."},

  { "image": "", "text" : "In my experience, everything we accomplish is the accumulation of many, many little steps. Leaving the house or opening my mouth usually was the first step. So I would say leaving the house and opening your mouth is most important in this life."},
  { "image": "", "text" : "<span>In addition to collages, do you use any other techniques like watercolors, colors, ink or another method?</span>"},
  { "image": "", "text" : "The only other art form I practice is ringing random doorbells. When I am in a new city, I sometimes look at the name plates on a random house, pick an interesting sounding name and press the button."},
  { "image": "", "text" : "<span>What means 'Speial Guest' to you?</span>"},
  { "image": "", "text" : "It's a strangely fitting name. It expresses well the feeling of not belonging somewhere in the first place. But being there anyhow."},
  { "image": "", "text" : "<span>What is the process that you really like doing in your work?</span>"},
  { "image": "", "text" : "I like the process of dreaming up a new piece. And I like the process of drinking a coke after all the work is done and I glued my piece to the wall."},
  { "image": "", "text" : "<span>What inspires you?</span>"},
  { "image": "", "text" : "Most of my works are autobiographical. They capture something that I experienced or something that is currently going on in my life. I get a lot of energy when I see the works of other artists. Museums and art galleries are my favorite places."},
