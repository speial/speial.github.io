They also run a nice little gallery which I like to visit from time to time. One night, when I walked past their gallery, I noticed some brochures in front of the door. I took one and thought 'My art will probably never make it into a Gudberg Nerger print. But this Gudberg Nerger print will make it into my art'. Back home I started reassembling it. This portrait is what came out of it.</p>"
