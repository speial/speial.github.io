<div class=caption><p>The Doppeldenk flyers turned out to be a very unique material to work with. They contain no gradients at all. Just solid colors. Screaming colors. And the glossy coating made it a lot harder to cut them.</p><p>This is what I made of them.</p><p>Sorry for the traces of glue that are left on some parts of the image. They are the result of moving the pieces around after I already positioned them. Maybe I can remove them later. I am not sure. So far I always managed to avoid this. This time it happened. Glue happens.</p></div>
