On my strolls through Hamburg's galleries, I recently found 50 pieces of this interesting flyer. It is for the exhibition "Transition | Cross | One" by Darko Caramello which is currently taking place at the Affenfaust gallery. From what I read, it shows a photogram. Photographic paper that was exposed directly to the sun.<br>
<br>
I gave one of them away. So now I have 49 flyers to make a collage from. 49 is a lot. Not sure if I ever had that many of one single flyer. This will give me a lot of room to experiment.<br>
<br>
Usually I try to finish my work by the opening day. Since that is already over, I feel like I have unlimited time to make something of these. So this will be ready when it's ready.

Cutting through the first three flyers. A face starts to emerge. There is no way back now. 46 flyers left to go.
