<div class=caption><p>Showtime Bambi</p><p>Since I finished <a href='../showtime/'>Showtime</a> last month, it is sitting at my place. That feels strange. A deer is not meant to be kept at home. But the piece is too big to easily bring it somewhere. Also, I did not find a reliable way to hang framed pieces yet. So what I did: I took the green Bambi out of the image and put it in a little travel frame. As a background, I used a nice dark flyer by .. I'm not sure who. It was the flyer for the exhibition 'Zerberus' at Feinkunst Krüger which showed works by Björn Holzweg, Ki Yoon Ko and Elmar Lause. From the looks of it, my guess is that it is a piece by Elmar Lause.</p><p>Then yesterday, when I dropped by the fabulous group show '25 Jahre 4000', I left it in the public restroom.</p><p>One more kid out of the house.</p></div>

<div class=caption>This is how Showtime now looks like. Bambi is gone. Will it ever return?</div>
