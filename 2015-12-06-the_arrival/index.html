<div class=caption><p>By 2015, I had been gluing my pieces to the toilet walls of my favorite galleries for about 3 years. Without any feedback whatsoever. I had no idea if anybody else took notice of the little world I was creating for myself.</p><p>Then Feinkunst Kr체ger announced on social media that they are interested in featuring one of my pieces in the tenth anniversary of their yearly group show, "Don't Wake Daddy".</p><p>That inspired me to make this large piece. It's about 1m in size and made from the flyers of the previous 9 Don't Wake Daddy Shows. Featuring Mia M채kil채, Moki, Van Arno, Brendan Danielsson, Marcus Sch채fer, Christian Rex van Minnen and Fred Stonehouse.</p></div>
