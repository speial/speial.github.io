    "text" : "<p>On my strolls through Hamburg's galleries, I recently found 50 pieces of this interesting flyer. It is for the exhibition 'Transition | Cross | One' by Darko Caramello which is currently taking place at the Affenfaust gallery. From what I read, it shows a photogram. Photographic paper that was exposed directly to the sun.</p><p>I gave one of them away. So now I have 49 flyers to make a collage from. 49 is a lot. Not sure if I ever had that many of one single flyer. This will give me a lot of room to experiment.</p><p>Usually I try to finish my work by the opening day. Since that is already over, I feel like I have unlimited time to make something of these. So this will be ready when it's ready.</p>" },
