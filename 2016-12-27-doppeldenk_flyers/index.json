    "text" : "<p>These are some interesting flyers I found recently. For the exhibition 'Totentanz' by the art duo Doppeldenk from Leipzig. The exhibition is currently taking place at the Affenfaust Galerie in Hamburg.</p><p>It seems to be the photo of an acrylic painting. Made solely of solid colors and rectangular shapes. They have a glossy coating, which makes the colors even more intense.</p>"}
