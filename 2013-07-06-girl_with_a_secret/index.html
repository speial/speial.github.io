<div class=caption><p>A small piece from 2013 made with the beautiful colors of Roman Klonek. <p>I dig the way Roman created his own visual language and uses woodcuts as his medium. This is a collage I made from his exhibition flyer for the exhibition 'Out of the woods' at Feinkunst Kr√ºger.</p><p>My intention was to picture a girl holding a certain object. When I was finished, I was not sure if it is recognizable. So I asked a friend of mine what she is holding. And he replied 'A secret!'. This is how this piece got its name.</p></div>
